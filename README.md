### Description

This utility either stops or permits the Messenger service. This service, if permitted, allows users to send annoying 'Net Send' messages to your computer. I have seen tons of requests for a program like this; and even websites that are selling an application with the exact same functionality as this one for over $50...crazy. Anyway, if these messages are annoying you, this is the program for you. Hope it helps you out. Comments, threats, jokes are always appreciated! :) By the way, this was tested on a Windows XP machine; nothing else. If it doesn't work for any other operating system, please let me know.
